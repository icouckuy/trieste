.. function:: optimize(space: trieste.space.SearchSpace, target_func: TensorMapping) -> trieste.type.TensorType

   Return the point in ``space`` (with shape S) that maximises the function ``target_func``, as the
   single entry in a 1 by S tensor.

   ``target_func`` must satisfy the following:

     * indices in the leading dimension for both the argument and the result of ``target_func``
       must run over points in the space. For example, the element at index 0 is the first point,
       and the element at index 1 is the second.
     * the result of ``target_func`` must have exactly one additional dimension of size 1. This is
       needed to unambiguously define a maximum.

   :param space: The space of points over which to search.
   :param target_func: The function to maximise.
   :return: The point in ``space`` that maximises ``target_func``.
