===============================

.. py:module:: trieste.acquisition.rule

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   This module contains acquisition rules, which choose the optimal point(s) to query on each step of
   the Bayesian optimization process.



Module Contents
---------------

.. data:: S
   

   Unbound type variable. 


.. data:: SP
   

   Contravariant type variable bound to :class:`SearchSpace`. 


.. class:: AcquisitionRule

   Bases: :class:`abc.ABC`, :class:`Generic[S, SP]`

   The central component of the acquisition API. 

   .. method:: acquire(self, search_space: SP, datasets: Mapping[(str, Dataset)], models: Mapping[(str, ProbabilisticModel)], state: Optional[S]) -> Tuple[(TensorType, S)]
      :abstractmethod:

      Return the optimal points within the specified ``search_space``, where optimality is defined
      by the acquisition rule.

      **Type hints:**
        - The global search space must be a :class:`~trieste.space.SearchSpace`. The exact type
          of :class:`~trieste.space.SearchSpace` depends on the specific
          :class:`AcquisitionRule`.
        - Each :class:`AcquisitionRule` must define the type of its corresponding acquisition
          state (if the rule is stateless, this type can be `None`). The ``state`` passed
          to this method, and the state returned, must both be of that type.

      :param search_space: The global search space over which the optimization problem
          is defined.
      :param datasets: The known observer query points and observations for each tag.
      :param models: The model to use for each :class:`~trieste.data.Dataset` in ``datasets``
          (matched by tag).
      :param state: The acquisition state from the previous step, if there was a previous step,
          else `None`.
      :return: The optimal points and the acquisition state for this step.



.. data:: OBJECTIVE
   :annotation: :Final[str] = OBJECTIVE

   A tag typically used by acquisition rules to denote the data sets and models corresponding to the
   optimization objective.


.. class:: EfficientGlobalOptimization(builder: Optional[AcquisitionFunctionBuilder] = None)


   Bases: :class:`AcquisitionRule[None, SearchSpace]`

   Implements the Efficient Global Optimization, or EGO, algorithm. 

   :param builder: The acquisition function builder to use.
       :class:`EfficientGlobalOptimization` will attempt to **maximise** the corresponding
       acquisition function. Defaults to :class:`~trieste.acquisition.ExpectedImprovement`
       with tag `OBJECTIVE`.

   .. method:: acquire(self, search_space: trieste.space.SearchSpace, datasets: Mapping[(str, Dataset)], models: Mapping[(str, ProbabilisticModel)], state: None = None) -> Tuple[(TensorType, None)]

      Return the query point that optimizes the acquisition function produced by `builder` (see
      :meth:`__init__`).

      :param search_space: The global search space over which the optimization problem
          is defined.
      :param datasets: The known observer query points and observations.
      :param models: The models of the specified ``datasets``.
      :param state: Unused.
      :return: The single point to query, and `None`.



.. class:: ThompsonSampling(num_search_space_samples: int, num_query_points: int)


   Bases: :class:`AcquisitionRule[None, SearchSpace]`

   Implements Thompson sampling for choosing optimal points. 

   :param num_search_space_samples: The number of points at which to sample the posterior.
   :param num_query_points: The number of points to acquire.

   .. method:: acquire(self, search_space: trieste.space.SearchSpace, datasets: Mapping[(str, Dataset)], models: Mapping[(str, ProbabilisticModel)], state: None = None) -> Tuple[(TensorType, None)]

      Sample `num_search_space_samples` (see :meth:`__init__`) points from the
      ``search_space``. Of those points, return the `num_query_points` points at which
      random samples yield the **minima** of the model posterior.

      :param search_space: The global search space over which the optimization problem
          is defined.
      :param datasets: Unused.
      :param models: The model of the known data. Uses the single key `OBJECTIVE`.
      :param state: Unused.
      :return: The `num_query_points` points to query, and `None`.
      :raise ValueError: If ``models`` do not contain the key `OBJECTIVE`, or it contains any
          other key.



.. class:: TrustRegion(builder: Optional[AcquisitionFunctionBuilder] = None, beta: float = 0.7, kappa: float = 0.0001)


   Bases: :class:`AcquisitionRule['TrustRegion.State', Box]`

   Implements the *trust region* acquisition algorithm. 

   :param builder: The acquisition function builder to use. :class:`TrustRegion` will attempt
       to **maximise** the corresponding acquisition function. Defaults to
       :class:`~trieste.acquisition.ExpectedImprovement` with tag `OBJECTIVE`.
   :param beta: The inverse of the trust region contraction factor.
   :param kappa: Scales the threshold for the minimal improvement required for a step to be
       considered a success.

   .. class:: State

      The acquisition state for the :class:`TrustRegion` acquisition rule. 

      .. attribute:: acquisition_space
         :annotation: :Box

         The search space. 


      .. attribute:: eps
         :annotation: :TensorType

         The (maximum) vector from the current best point to each bound of the acquisition space.


      .. attribute:: y_min
         :annotation: :TensorType

         The minimum observed value. 


      .. attribute:: is_global
         :annotation: :Union[TensorType, bool]

         `True` if the search space was global, else `False` if it was local. May be a scalar boolean
         `TensorType` instead of a `bool`.



   .. method:: acquire(self, search_space: trieste.space.Box, datasets: Mapping[(str, Dataset)], models: Mapping[(str, ProbabilisticModel)], state: Optional[State]) -> Tuple[(TensorType, State)]

      Acquire one new query point according the trust region algorithm. Return the new query point
      along with the final acquisition state from this step.

      If no ``state`` is specified (it is `None`), ``search_space`` is used as
      the search space for this step.

      If a ``state`` is specified, and the new optimum improves over the previous optimum
      by some threshold (that scales linearly with ``kappa``), the previous acquisition is
      considered successful.

      If the previous acquisition was successful, ``search_space`` is used as the new
      search space. If the previous step was unsuccessful, the search space is changed to the
      trust region if it was global, and vice versa.

      If the previous acquisition was over the trust region, the size of the trust region is
      modified. If the previous acquisition was successful, the size is increased by a factor
      ``1 / beta``. Conversely, if it was unsuccessful, the size is reduced by the factor
      ``beta``.

      **Note:** The acquisition search space will never extend beyond the boundary of the
      ``search_space``. For a local search, the actual search space will be the
      intersection of the trust region and ``search_space``.

      :param search_space: The global search space for the optimization problem.
      :param datasets: The known observer query points and observations. Uses the data for key
          `OBJECTIVE` to calculate the new trust region.
      :param models: The models of the specified ``datasets``.
      :param state: The acquisition state from the previous step, if there was a previous step,
          else `None`.
      :return: A 2-tuple of the query point and the acquisition state for this step.
      :raise KeyError: If ``datasets`` does not contain the key `OBJECTIVE`.



.. class:: BatchAcquisitionRule(num_query_points: int, builder: trieste.acquisition.function.BatchAcquisitionFunctionBuilder)


   Bases: :class:`AcquisitionRule[None, SearchSpace]`

   Implements an acquisition rule for a batch of query points. 

   :param num_query_points: The number of points to acquire.
   :param builder: The acquisition function builder to use. :class:`BatchAcquisitionRule` will
       attempt to **maximise** the corresponding acquisition function.

   .. method:: acquire(self, search_space: trieste.space.SearchSpace, datasets: Mapping[(str, Dataset)], models: Mapping[(str, ProbabilisticModel)], state: None = None) -> Tuple[(TensorType, None)]

      Return the batch of query points that optimizes the acquisition function produced by
      `builder` (see :meth:`__init__`).

      :param search_space: The global search space over which the optimization problem is defined.
      :param datasets: The known observer query points and observations.
      :param models: The models of the specified ``datasets``.
      :param state: Unused.
      :return: The batch of points to query, and `None`.
